Twitter-Trends
==============

This was a project submitted for the UC Berkeley CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Summer 2014 class. This is the first class in a series of 3 classes that make up lower division Computer Science requirements.

In this project, I developed a geographic visualization of Twitter data across the USA.

The map displayed depicts how the people in different states feel about California. The image is generated by:

Collecting public Twitter posts (Tweets) that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "cali" query term,

Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each Tweet, based on all of the words it contains,

Aggregating Tweets by the state with the closest geographic center, and finally

Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its Tweets. Yellow means positive sentiment; blue means negative.
